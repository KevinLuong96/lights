#Lights

##Motivation
Lights was created to act as a front end interface which is able to communicate
to the back end web server my uncles installed into my house to control the lights
in the basement. The existing interface was clunky and consisted of complex
commands to be typed into the address bar. Lights has a much sleeker interface,
and a higher ease of use stemming from buttons as opposed to text commands.
Lights uses AJAX requests to send commands to the web server and read the response
in order to update the UI
